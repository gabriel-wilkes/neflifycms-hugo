This project is a little bit different in that it isn't a website but it uses web technologies. It is an interactive ebook about astronomy. Azul Technology did not develop the book content but it was brought in to add some additonal interactivity that was only possible using code.

Specifically  Gabriel Wilkes coded an interactive feature where you could look around a martian surface by moving an iPad. Also, interactive quizzes at the end of each chapter were coded using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
