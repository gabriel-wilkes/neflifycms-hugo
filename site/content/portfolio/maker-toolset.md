Maker Toolset creates and runs bilingual technology clubs and workshops in the Tokyo area. Gabriel Wilkes not only created the website for Maker Toolset but is also a founding member and helped to develop and teach many Maker Toolset programs. 

Some examples of programs run were after-school clubs and workshops to teach programing using robotics and Minecraft. The website itself was built by Azul Technology using Wordpress. WooCommerce and Paypal were used to create the signup up pages, checkout and payments for the workshops and clubs.
