      <description>This site was built using Squarespace, Ecwid, Stripe and some custom HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery . Squarespace with a heavy design focus and ease of use was a perfect fit for a fashion site. However, Squarespace doesn&amp;rsquo;t support Japanese yen with their ecommerce functionality.
Ecwid is an ecommerce platform that can be added to any site and it supports Japanese yen and Japanese language checkout. Ecwid works with Stripe to process payments.</description>

      <description>This site was built using Squarespace, Stripe and some custom HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Although the sunglasses are made in and shipped from Japan the site was designed for a more international audience. The language is only in English and the pricing is in US dollars.
Squarespace&amp;rsquo;s built-in ecommerce platform is used along with it&amp;rsquo;s integration with Stripe making the ecommerce setup very straightforward. Some custom code was added to add a few special features requested by the site owners including a zoom in on products when hovering over them and color selectors to choose various sunglass colors.</description>
