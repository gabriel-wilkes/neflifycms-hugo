# Website for Azul Technology

[This website](https://azul.technology) is built with static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [Netlify CMS](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms), [Netlify Idenity](https://www.netlify.com/docs/identity/), and [Hugo theme Forty](https://github.com/MarcusVirg/forty). The website is git-backed, changes to this repository automatically deploy to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). 

Editing is locally with git or using [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io/). Netlify CMS can also be used but it not yet at parity with Forestry.io. Netlify CMS is still pretty new though and looks to be improving. Will revisit using it more later.
